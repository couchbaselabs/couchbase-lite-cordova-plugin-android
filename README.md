# overview
A reference implementation of a [cordova native plugin](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/10.x/guide/hybrid/plugins/index.html) for couchbase lite on Android. 

In order to use Couchbase Lite as embedded database within your Cordova-based app, you will need a way to access Couchbase Liteâ€™s native APIs from within your Cordova web application. Cordova plugins allow web-based apps running in a Cordova webview to access native platform functionality through a Javascript interface.

The Cordova plugin example exports a subset of native Couchbase Lite API functionality. This is intended to be used as a reference. You can extend this plugin to expose other relevant APIs per [plugin development guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/10.x/guide/platforms/android/plugin.html)
